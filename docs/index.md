# Charm
Charm is a **mod for Minecraft 1.16.4**, inspired by [Quark](https://quark.vazkii.us/), that adds to the vanilla experience of Minecraft without drastically changing its gameplay.
Charm does not require **Quark** to be installed but is designed to play nicely with it and extend some of its features.

It's a *modular* mod in that you can turn on or off any of the mod features via the config file.  As of version 2.1.1, it works on both **Fabric** and **Forge**.

## Installation for Fabric
To play Charm on Fabric, you must:
* install the **Java Edition** of Minecraft.  We recommend [MultiMC]() to more easily install and run Minecraft with mods
* install the most up-to-date [version of Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/)
* download the latest version of [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and drop the jar file in your **mods** folder
* download the latest version of [Charm](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/charm) and drop the jar file in your **mods** folder. Make sure you choose the **Fabric** version!

## Installation for Forge
To play Charm on Forge, you must:
* install the **Java Edition** of Minecraft.  We recommend [MultiMC]() to more easily install and run Minecraft with mods
* install the most up-to-date [version of Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.4.html)
* download the latest version of [Charm](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/charm) and drop the jar file in your **mods** folder. Make sure you choose the **Forge** version!

After the game starts for the first time, you can edit the **charm.toml** file (in the config folder) to change Charm's configuration.
Each of Charm's features can be disabled or tweaked to fit your playstyle.

## For older versions of Minecraft
Charm for Minecraft 1.12 and Minecraft 1.15 are no longer being actively maintained.  `1.12` is occasionally supported with serious bug fixes.
You can read the [1.12 documentation here]({{site.baseurl}}/features-1.12/index) and the [1.15 documentation here]({{site.baseurl}}/features-1.15/index).
