## Block of Ender Pearls
![Block of Ender Pearls](https://i.postimg.cc/k5kZnkBj/Block-of-ender-pearls.png)
Craft a Block of Ender Pearls from 9 ender pearls.  If a silverfish burrows into an Ender Pearl Block, it will turn into an Endermite.  Eating a Chorus Fruit will teleport you to the nearest Ender Pearl Block rather than a random location.  Both features are configurable.

## Block of Rotten Flesh
![Block of Rotten Flesh](https://i.postimg.cc/fW7FNqZK/Block-of-rotten-flesh.png)
Craft 9 rotten flesh into a Block of Rotten Flesh for storage.  When placed in the world, the block will turn to dirt when next to water.  Placing a block under farmland will increase the speed at which planted crops grow.

Rotten Flesh blocks are also compostable by default.

## Smooth Glowstone

Smelt glowstone in a furnace to get smooth glowstone.  It has a smoother texture and emits the same light level.  Use a **Silk Touch** enchanted pickaxe to pickup the block again.
