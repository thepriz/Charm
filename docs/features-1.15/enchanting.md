Combine the **Homing** enchanted book with a pickaxe, shovel or hoe on an anvil to enable the tool to help you locate ore. The tool will be attracted to ore of the same ingots/gems that make up the head of the tool.

By right-clicking on a block, you will hear a sound that rises in pitch as you get closer to the ore. Doing so will decrease the durability of the tool.
