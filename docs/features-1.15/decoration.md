## All the Barrels
![All the Barrels](https://i.postimg.cc/sDVLDPgR/All-the-barrels.png)
Barrels of each type of vanilla wood can be crafted using the respective wood planks and slabs.  These extra barrels work with **Quark**'s drop-off and sort features.

## Bookshelf Chests
![Bookshelf Chests](https://i.postimg.cc/tJzmNJDf/Bookshelf-chests.png)
This is a bookshelf that has 9 inventory slots for storing books.  It provides the same enchanting power as a normal bookshelf as long as there is at least 1 slot occupied, and can be crafted from each of the 6 vanilla wood types.

The texture will change as books are added or removed.

If the **Quark** mod is enabled, the **Bookshelf Chest** uses Quark's drop-off and sort functionality.

Contents can be measured using a comparator, outputting a signal based on the number of filled slots rather than the quantity of items.

## Crates

Crates offer a smaller storage solution than a chest or barrel with the benefit of being transportable making it an early game alternative to shulkerboxes.  Crates are also available in all vanilla wood variants.

The contents can be measured using a comparator, like a vanilla chest.

If the **Quark** mod is enabled, **Crates** use Quark's drop-off and sort functionality.
            
### Sealed crates
You may seal a crate with an iron ingot on an anvil - the only way to release items from a sealed crate is to break it open.  A sealed crate does not let you access its inventory and is not transportable even with silk touch.

## Gold Lanterns

A **Gold Lantern** is crafted with gold nuggets instead of iron nuggets.
