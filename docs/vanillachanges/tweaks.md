## Tweaks

### Music improvements
![Music improvements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
When a music disc plays in a jukebox, background music will be stopped and prevented from playing so that you don't get two tracks playing at the same time.

Creative background music may now play in survival mode.  In addition, the delay between ambient music tracks has been shortened.

### Armor invisibility
![Armor invisibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
Leather and chaimmail armor is now completely invisible and does not increase mob awareness when drinking a **Potion of Invisibility**, giving you a bit more protection while you ninja.

### Automatic recipe unlock
![Automatic recipe unlock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
All recipes will be available on login.  This was the first feature written for 1.14 before **Quark** was developed as I couldn't live without it.  Quark's implementation is better, so this feature will automatically disable itself if Quark is present. 

### Campfires no damage
![Campfires no damage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
Campfires no longer damage mobs.
By default, Soul Campfires still cause damage.

### Dirt to Path
![Dirt to Path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
Right-clicking dirt with a shovel turns it into grass path.

If **Quark** is present, this feature is disabled by default.

### Feather Falling on crops
![Feather Falling on crops](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
A player wearing feather falling enchanted boots will not trample crops.

### Hoe Harvesting

### Inventory tidying

### Path to Dirt
![Path to Dirt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
Right-clicking on a grass path block with a hoe turns it back into dirt.

### Portable Crafting

If you have a crafting table in your inventory, you can open the 3x3 crafting grid with an inventory button or by pressing the `V` key (configurable in control settings) without having to place the crafting table down.

### Remove potion glint
![Remove potion glint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)

[1.17 only] Removes the dark outer overlay when zooming in with the spyglass, giving you the full view.

### Shulker Box tooltips
![Shulker Box tooltips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)

### Sleep improvements
![Sleep improvements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
By default only one player needs to sleep in order to end the night.

In addition, a configuration option has been added for the sleep animation to be finished more quickly.

If **Quark** is present, this feature is disabled by default.

### Stackable enchanted books
![Stackable enchanted books](https://github.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/blob/master/web/charm-features/stackable-books.png?raw=true)
Enchanted books of the same type can stack up to 16.

### Stackable potions
![Stackable potions](https://github.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/blob/master/web/charm-features/stacking-potions.png?raw=true)
Potions, water bottles, potion bases (mundane, awkward etc) and their splash/lingering varieties can stack up to 16, making them sortable and more convenient to carry around.

### Use Totem of Undying from inventory
![Use totem of Undying from inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
As long as a Totem of Undying is in your inventory (rather than specifically your main- or off-hand) it will be consumed to protect you from death.
