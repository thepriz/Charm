### Netherite Nuggets

Netherite can be broken into nuggets, and netherite nuggets can be combined to create a netherite ingot.
Use a Netherite nugget to reduce the repair cost of tools and armor on an anvil.

### Tinted Enchantment

A tool with the **Tinted** enchantment may be combined with a dye on the anvil to change the enchantment glint color.
This also works for lodestone compasses, allowing you to color-code destinations.
