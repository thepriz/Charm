## Decoration

### Block of Ender Pearls
![Block of Ender Pearls](https://github.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/blob/master/web/charm-features/ender-pearl-block.png?raw=true)
Craft a Block of Ender Pearls from 9 ender pearls.  If a silverfish burrows into an Ender Pearl Block, it will turn into an Endermite.  Eating a Chorus Fruit will teleport you to the nearest Ender Pearl Block rather than a random location.  Both features are configurable.

### Bookcases
![Bookcases](https://github.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/blob/87b93c3ddf9d4332cc7c8e0b3fb65ae2baa99dae/web/charm-features/bookcases-retextured.png?raw=true)
A bookshelf that has 18 inventory slots for storing books.
It provides the same enchanting power as a normal bookshelf as long as there is at least 1 slot occupied and can be crafted from each of the 8 vanilla wood types.

The texture will change as books are added or removed.

Contents can be measured using a comparator, outputting a signal based on the number of filled slots rather than the quantity of items.

### Candles

Candles are made from beeswax and have a lower ambient light than torches.

The contents can be measured using a comparator, like a vanilla chest.
