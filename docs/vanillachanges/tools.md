Right-click a bat with an empty bucket to capture it (if you can!) and get the **Bat in a Bucket**.

### Glowballs
![Glowballs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
Combine a snowball with glowstone dust to get a glowball. You can throw it like a snowball and it will leave a little glowing blob where it impacts.

### Raid Horns
![Raid Horns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenhjol/Charm-Assets/master/web/charm-features/nope.png)
A **Raid Horn** may be used to cancel a village raid that is in progress.  When there is no raid in progress,
blowing a raid horn will call a wandering pillager patrol group to spawn nearby.

The Raid Horn has a 5% chance to drop from a patrol leader.
